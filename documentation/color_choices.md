### Initial
I have not had much success with color choice in the past using online tools such as picking colors from imagery via adobe or from color pallet wheels. My color choices pass accessibility audits but something is missing, so this time, I started with the pros at [Sherwin Williams](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6790-adriatic-sea#/6790/?s=coordinatingColors&p=PS0) and came up with the following colors:

### Round 2
I then went to dribble.com and plugged in each of the colors from Sherwin Williams to find others' pallets that had a cheerful look. Unfortunately Adriatic Blue, Aesthetic White, and Felted Wool all provided me with rather depressing options. Luckily Bravo Blue(\#d3e7e9) turned up a lot of more cheerful looking sites.

So I'm hoping I'll have success with the Daily UI 004 color's pallet.

### Final Answer
After I chose [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/)  as my CSS framework, I noticed that my colors were close to Bulma's primary colors, but didn't carry quite the cheerfulness of Bulma. I ditched the colors and made slight modifications to bulma and have the following colors on my site:
