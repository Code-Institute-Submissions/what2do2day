### Header Font
The home page lends itself to a comic strip so I searched Google's handwriting fonts and flagged the top 5 that matched what I had envisioned and typed some example lead text.
- [WalterTurncoat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Walter+Turncoat)
<img src="images/fonts/Walter%20Turncoat.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="walter turncoat font"/>
- [Sriracha](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sriracha)
<img src="images/fonts/images/fonts/Sriracha.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="srirach font"/>
- [Coming Soon](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Coming+Soon)
<img src="images/fonts/images/fonts/Coming%20Soon.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="coming soon font"/>
- [Caveat Brush](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat+Brush)
<img src="images/fonts/images/fonts/Coming%20Soon.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="coming soon font"/>
- [Patrick Hand SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC)

In my opinion, the Patrick Hand SC font presented itself perfectly for cartoon writing when typing out potential lead text. It was easy to read and I could discern where true capitalization was and saw a difference between capital I's followed by lower case L's.

### Main Font
Next I produced a short list of fonts for my main content by looking at google's suggested pairings of fonts with Patrick Hand SC and a list of [best fonts](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-google-fonts/):

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
<img src="images/fonts/images/fonts/Lato.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="lato font"/>
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
<img src="images/fonts/images/fonts/Open%20Sans.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="open sans font"/>
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)
<img src="images/fonts/images/fonts/Raleway.png" width="90%" height="auto" alt="Raleway font"/>

While Open Sans matched the curvy flowing fonts which I was trying to achieve with for my main content, I could not distinguish a capital I from a lower case l, so I chose Raleway as it met that criteria. I don't plan on using many different font weights so I only imported those for normal and bold:

`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Patrick+Hand+SC&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`
`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:500,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`
