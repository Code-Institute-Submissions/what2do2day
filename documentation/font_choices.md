### Header Font
The home page lends itself to a comic strip so I searched Google's handwriting fonts and flagged the top 5 that matched what I had envisioned and typed some example lead text.
- [WalterTurncoat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Walter+Turncoat)
- [Sriracha](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sriracha)
- [Coming Soon](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Coming+Soon)
- [Caveat Brush](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat+Brush)
- [Patrick Hand SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC)

In my opinion, the Patrick Hand SC font presented itself perfectly for cartoon writing when typing out potential lead text. It was easy to read and I could discern where true capitalization was and saw a difference between capital I's followed by lower case L's.

### Main Font
Next I produced a short list of fonts for my main content by looking at google's suggested pairings of fonts with Patrick Hand SC a list of [best fonts](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-google-fonts/):

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)

While Open Sans matched the curvy flowing fonts which I was trying to achieve with for my main content, I could not distinguish a capital I from a lower case l, so I chose Raleway as it met that criteria. I don't plan on using many different font weights so I only imported those for normal and bold.
