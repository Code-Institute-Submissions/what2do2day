## Ideation
Upon reading the suggested projects for the Data Centric Milestone Project, I came up with

2 Ideas:

### Texting Translator:

> External Goals
>  - Lookup definitions so you know what LOL and MILF means before determining if you need to have a serious talk with your children
>  - Find out what your savvy friend means rather than embarrassing yourself by asking your clueless parents
>  - Correct poor definitions by providing a new one and down voting the older definitions so people are better informed
>
> Site Owner's Goals
>  - Publish T-shirts, & stickers mugs for benign but up to date trends
>
> Features
>   - Create an app that allows users to upload Texting Terms, definitions 
>   - Allow users to Up and Down voting if Definition is Accurate or not.
>   - Create back end code to manage:
>     - Terms
>     - Definitions
>     - Votes
>   - Search, allow users to search terms for a texting phrase they are unfamiliar with 
>   - Metrics about what words were search for the most so owner can Stock Online store accordingly

### What2Do2Day:

> External Goals
>  - As a parent, find something safe for your kids to do near home that doesn't break the bank
>  - As a kid, find something that's interests me to do with my friends when mom and dad take away my electronics
>  - As a place or organization, bring attention to your business or group by being involved in the community
> 
> Site Owner's Goal
>  - Earn money from affiliate links to businesses that post their places on site when links lead to online sales
>  - Track most popular activities on site to score some money from ads
> 
> Features

>  - Allow users to write reviews about places and rate them
>  - Allow users to follow a place so they know new events posted by that business
>  - Allow users to join an event so other members know how many people might show up 
>  - Create back end code to manage:
>    - Reviews
>    - Places
>    - Events
>  - Search, allow searching by activity as means to filter results
>  - Metrics - track follows to business and joins to business as well as visitors to site.

## Pros and Cons
Out of these two concepts, I weighed the pros and cons of each:

|             Pros               |                        Cons                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| MVP could go live              | Rather Simple                                      |
| Moderate  UX                   | No API integration                                 |
| Scalable to world market       | MVP would be ready for Market                      |
| Ad & product earnings moderate |                                                    |

|             Pros               |                        Cons                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Integration with Google Maps   | Very complex                                       |
| Challenging UX                 | MVP not production worthy, anyone can make updates |
| Scalable to world market       | MVP not production worthy, (kid safety first)      |
| Earnings from Ads is high      |                                                    |
| Social Need is high            |                                                    |

## Decision
 What2Do2Day has the ability to reach a broader scope of users and could potentially take off like the Nextdoor app.  What2Do2Day is more intriguing and likely to keep users coming back to the site. As a developer, the What2Do2Day app will provide greater value in the long term towards my coding skills due to it's complexity.
